- ✅ POST /api/v1/audit/verify - Hash chain verification
- ✅ GET /api/v1/audit/stats - Real-time statistics
- ✅ POST /api/v1/export - Create export jobs
- ✅ GET /api/v1/export - List export jobs
- ✅ GET /api/v1/export/{id}/download - Secure download URLs

**Services:**

- ✅ AuditService with async locks for hash chain consistency
- ✅ ExportService with S3 integration and multiple formats
- ✅ WORM compliance verification
- ✅ Structured logging throughout

### Frontend UI (apps/admin/src/pages/Security/AuditLogs.tsx)

**Admin Interface Features:**

- ✅ Real-time audit event dashboard
- ✅ Advanced search and filtering
- ✅ Export job creation and management
- ✅ Hash chain integrity verification
- ✅ Event details modal with full audit context
- ✅ Statistics cards showing system health
- ✅ Responsive design with tabs and pagination

**Search & Filter Capabilities:**

- ✅ Full-text search across audit events
- ✅ Filter by event type, user, risk level
- ✅ Date range filtering
- ✅ Real-time search with pagination

**Export Management:**

- ✅ Create exports with custom names and formats
- ✅ Apply current filters to exports
- ✅ Track export job status
- ✅ Secure download links for completed exports

### Infrastructure & Deployment

**Production Ready:**

- ✅ Dockerfile with security best practices
- ✅ Requirements.txt with pinned dependencies
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Health checks for container orchestration
- ✅ Comprehensive README with usage examples

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Features

### WORM Compliance

- **Database Level**: PostgreSQL triggers prevent any modifications to audit_events table
- **Application Level**: Immutable models with hash verification
- **API Level**: No UPDATE or DELETE endpoints for audit events

### Hash Chain Integrity

- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Each event hashes previous event + current data
- **Tamper Detection**: Verification can detect any chain breaks
- **Thread Safety**: Async locks ensure consistent hash chains during concurrent writes

### Export Security

- **S3 Presigned URLs**: Time-limited, secure download links
- **Access Control**: Export jobs tied to requesting user
- **Data Formats**: Support for CSV, JSON, and Excel with proper escaping

## 📊 Monitoring & Statistics

### Real-time Metrics

- Total audit events count
- Events in last 24 hours
- Unique active users (24h)
- High-risk events count
- Hash chain verification status

### Health Monitoring

- Basic health endpoint
- Database connectivity checks
- WORM compliance verification
- Kubernetes-ready liveness/readiness probes

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Creating Audit Events

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "user.login",
    "user_id": "admin123", 
    "action": "admin_panel_access",
    "resource_type": "admin_dashboard",
    "resource_id": "security_section",
    "details": {"section": "audit_logs"},
    "risk_level": "medium",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
  }'
```

### Searching & Filtering

```bash
# Search by event type
GET /api/v1/audit?event_type=user.login&page=1&page_size=50

# Filter by risk level and date range
GET /api/v1/audit?risk_level=high&start_date=2024-01-01T00:00:00&end_date=2024-01-31T23:59:59

# Search specific user activity
GET /api/v1/audit?user_id=admin123&search=login
```

### Export Operations

```bash
# Create export job
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/export?requested_by=admin" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_name": "Security Audit Report",
    "export_format": "xlsx",
    "filters": {"risk_level": "high"}
  }'

# Get download URL
GET /api/v1/export/{job_id}/download
```
