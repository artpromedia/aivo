# S2C-04 Integration Hub Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed Components

### Backend Service (services/integration-hub-svc/)

- **FastAPI Application**: Complete service setup with OpenTelemetry, CORS, security middleware

- **Database Models**:

  - `ApiKey` with tenant isolation, scopes, rotation, rate limiting
  - `Webhook` with HMAC secrets, event filtering, retry configuration
  - `WebhookDelivery` with status tracking, retry attempts, dead letter queue

- **API Routes**:

  - API Key CRUD: `/api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/api-keys`
  - Webhook CRUD: `/api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/webhooks`
  - Webhook Testing: `/api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/webhooks/{webhook_id}/test`
  - Delivery Replay: `/api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/webhook-deliveries/{delivery_id}/replay`

### Frontend Components (apps/admin/src/pages/Integrations/)

- **ApiKeys.tsx**: Complete API key management interface

  - Create API keys with scopes, expiration, rate limits
  - Key rotation with new expiration settings
  - Usage statistics and status tracking
  - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for new keys
  - Delete and status management

- **Webhooks.tsx**: Complete webhook management interface

  - Create webhooks with URL, events, retry configuration
  - Test webhook functionality with custom payloads
  - Delivery log viewing with status indicators
  - Replay failed deliveries
  - Enable/disable webhook status
  - Event subscription management

## ðŸš§ Next Steps (In Progress)

### Core Features Remaining

1. **Webhook Test to echo.site**: Implement sample webhook test functionality
2. **Webhook Delivery Worker**: Background service with exponential backoff
3. **HMAC Signature Validation**: SHA-256 signature generation and verification
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete integration validation

### Key Acceptance Criteria

- âœ… API key management with rotation
- âœ… Webhook configuration and management
- ðŸš§ Sample webhook test delivers to echo.site
- ðŸš§ Replay functionality for failed events
- ðŸš§ HMAC signature authentication

## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenancy

- All models include `tenant_id` for proper isolation
- Tenant-specific API endpoints and data access

### Security Features

- API key scoping and rate limiting
- HMAC webhook authentication
- Audit trails for all operations
- Secure key rotation

### Reliability Features

- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Dead letter queue for failed deliveries
- Comprehensive delivery status tracking
- Manual replay functionality

### Admin Experience

- Clean React UI with standard HTML/CSS (no external dependencies)
- Real-time status indicators
- Comprehensive management interfaces
- Copy-to-clipboard utilities
- Modal forms for complex operations

The implementation provides a complete foundation for enterprise API key and webhook management, ready for the final integration testing and deployment phases.
