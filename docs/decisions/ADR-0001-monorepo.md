# ADR 0001: Monorepo Architecture Decision

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on the repository structure for managing multiple related projects and packages. The options considered were:

1. **Separate repositories** - Each project/package in its own repository
2. **Monorepo** - All projects/packages in a single repository
3. **Hybrid approach** - Core shared code in one repo, applications in separate repos

## Decision

We will use a **monorepo** structure for this project.

## Rationale

### Advantages of Monorepo:

- **Atomic changes**: Changes across multiple packages can be made atomically
- **Shared tooling**: Consistent tooling, linting, and CI/CD across all packages
- **Easier refactoring**: Refactoring across package boundaries is simpler
- **Better developer experience**: Single checkout, unified build process
- **Code sharing**: Easier to share code between packages
- **Consistent versioning**: All packages can be versioned together

### Mitigating Disadvantages:

- **Repository size**: Use sparse checkout for CI/CD and individual developers
- **Build times**: Implement incremental builds and caching
- **Access control**: Use CODEOWNERS and branch protection rules
- **Release management**: Use automated release tools for independent package releases

## Consequences

### Positive:

- Simplified dependency management between packages
- Consistent code quality and standards
- Easier to maintain shared infrastructure
- Better visibility into cross-package changes

### Negative:

- Larger repository size
- Potential for tighter coupling between packages
- More complex CI/CD setup initially

## Implementation

- Use `/packages/` directory for individual packages
- Use `/tools/` for shared development tools
- Use `/docs/` for documentation and ADRs
- Implement tooling for:
  - Automated testing across packages
  - Automated releases
  - Dependency management
  - Code quality checks

## Alternatives Considered

### Separate Repositories

- **Pros**: Clear boundaries, independent releases, smaller repos
- **Cons**: Difficult cross-package changes, duplicated tooling, harder code sharing

### Hybrid Approach

- **Pros**: Balances some advantages of both approaches
- **Cons**: More complex setup, still some duplication
