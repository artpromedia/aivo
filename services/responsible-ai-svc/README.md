## Educational AI Ethics Framework

### Bias Auditing Standards
- **Statistical Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across demographic groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates by demographics
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar students receive similar AI recommendations
- **Counterfactual Fairness**: Decisions unchanged if student belonged to different demographic group

### Educational Use Case Validation
- **Academic Support**: AI recommendations enhance rather than replace teacher judgment
- **Special Education**: AI assists but never determines eligibility or service levels
- **Disciplinary Systems**: AI identifies patterns but human review required for actions
- **Parent Communication**: AI translations and summaries maintain family autonomy

### Continuous Improvement
- **Monthly Bias Reports**: Automated generation of bias audit summaries
- **Quarterly Stakeholder Reviews**: Educational community input on AI fairness
- **Annual Ethics Assessments**: Comprehensive review of AI impact on educational equity
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous bias drift detection with alert systems

## Compliance & Security
