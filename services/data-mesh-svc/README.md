# S2B-12: Data Mesh Infrastructure Service

## Overview

The Data Mesh service implements decentralized data architecture for educational AI, enabling domain-specific data ownership while maintaining governance, quality, and compliance across all K-12 educational data products.

## Architecture

### Core Principles

- **Domain-Oriented Data Ownership**: Each educational domain (curriculum, assessment, IEP, etc.) owns their data
- **Data as a Product**: Reusable educational data products with clear SLAs and documentation
- **Self-Serve Data Infrastructure**: Common platform for all educational data teams
- **Federated Computational Governance**: Decentralized governance with centralized policies

### Data Domains

1. **Student Information Systems (SIS)**: Enrollment, demographics, scheduling
2. **Assessment & Testing**: State tests, formative assessments, progress monitoring
3. **Special Education**: IEPs, evaluations, related services, compliance
4. **Curriculum & Instruction**: Standards, lessons, resources, pacing guides
5. **Attendance & Behavior**: Daily attendance, tardiness, disciplinary actions
6. **Financial**: Budgets, expenditures, grant tracking, meal programs
