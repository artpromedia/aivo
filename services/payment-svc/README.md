# Payment Service

A comprehensive payment processing service built with FastAPI and Stripe integration for handling subscription billing, trials, and webhook processing.

## Features

- **Guardian Trials**: 14-day free trials for guardians
- **Flexible Subscription Plans**: Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly, and Yearly billing
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Automatic discount calculations based on plan duration and sibling discounts
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing with checkout sessions and webhooks
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Handle both tenant-based and guardian-based subscriptions
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful endpoints for all payment operations
- **Webhook Processing**: Idempotent webhook handling for payment events
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of subscription and payment history

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database
- Stripe account with API keys

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set environment variables:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost:5432/payment_db"
export STRIPE_API_KEY="sk_test_..."
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

3. Run the service:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

- `GET /health` - Service health status

### Pricing

- `POST /pricing/calculate` - Calculate subscription pricing with discounts

### Trials

- `POST /trials/start` - Start a 14-day trial subscription

### Checkout

- `POST /checkout/sessions` - Create Stripe checkout session

### Subscriptions

- `GET /subscriptions/{id}` - Get subscription details
- `GET /subscriptions/tenant/{tenant_id}` - Get tenant subscriptions
- `GET /subscriptions/guardian/{guardian_id}` - Get guardian subscriptions
- `POST /subscriptions/{id}/cancel` - Cancel subscription

### Webhooks

- `POST /webhooks/stripe` - Process Stripe webhook events

## Pricing Structure

### Base Pricing
- **Monthly Base Rate**: $40 per seat per month

### Plan Discounts
- **Quarterly**: 20% off (3 months)
- **Half-yearly**: 30% off (6 months)
- **Yearly**: 50% off (12 months)

### Additional Discounts
- **Sibling Discount**: 10% off applied after plan discount

### Example Calculations

```python
# Monthly plan: 5 seats, no discounts
# Base: $40 Ã— 5 seats Ã— 1 month = $200
# Final: $200

# Yearly plan: 10 seats, with sibling discount
# Base: $40 Ã— 10 seats Ã— 12 months = $4,800
# Plan discount (50%): -$2,400
# After plan discount: $2,400
# Sibling discount (10%): -$240
# Final: $2,160
```

## Database Schema

### Subscription
- Tracks subscription lifecycle (trial â†’ active â†’ canceled)
- Supports both tenant and guardian subscriptions
- Stores pricing and discount information

### Invoice
- Records billing history and payment status
- Links to Stripe invoice objects
- Tracks payment amounts and due dates

### PaymentMethod
- Stores customer payment method details
- Links to Stripe payment method objects
- Manages default payment methods

### WebhookEvent
- Ensures idempotent webhook processing
- Tracks processed events and errors
- Prevents duplicate processing

### DiscountRule
- Configurable discount rules
- Supports percentage and fixed amount discounts
- Time-based validity periods

## Webhook Events

The service handles these Stripe webhook events:

- `checkout.session.completed` - Activates pending subscriptions
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Updates subscription status
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Marks subscriptions as canceled
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Records successful payments
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Handles payment failures

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_pricing.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Coverage

- **Pricing Service**: Tests all plan types, discount combinations, and edge cases
- **Subscription Service**: Tests trial creation, checkout sessions, and lifecycle management
- **Webhook Service**: Tests idempotent processing and all event types
- **API Endpoints**: Tests all HTTP endpoints with various scenarios
- **Database Models**: Tests model relationships and constraints

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `STRIPE_API_KEY`: Stripe secret API key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Stripe webhook endpoint secret
- `SQL_ECHO`: Enable SQL query logging (default: false)

### Database Configuration

The service uses async SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL:

```python
# Connection pool settings
pool_size=20
max_overflow=30
pool_pre_ping=True
pool_recycle=3600
```

## Architecture

### Service Layer Pattern
- **PricingService**: Handles all pricing calculations and discount logic
- **StripeService**: Wraps Stripe API calls with error handling
- **SubscriptionService**: Manages subscription lifecycle and business logic
- **WebhookService**: Processes Stripe webhooks with idempotency

### Database Layer
- Async SQLAlchemy with connection pooling
- Declarative models with relationships
- Migration support via Alembic

### API Layer
- FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Comprehensive error handling

## Error Handling

### Stripe Errors
All Stripe API errors are caught and returned with appropriate HTTP status codes:

```python
@app.exception_handler(stripe.error.StripeError)
async def stripe_error_handler(request: Request, exc: stripe.error.StripeError):
    return ErrorResponse(
        detail="Payment processing error",
        error_code=exc.code,
        stripe_error={...}
    )
```

### Validation Errors
Pydantic automatically validates request data and returns 422 for validation errors.

### Database Errors
SQLAlchemy errors are handled gracefully with rollback and appropriate error messages.

## Security

### API Security
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Input validation with Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries

### Data Security
- Sensitive data is not logged
- Stripe customer IDs used instead of storing payment details
- Environment variables for secrets

## Deployment

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Health Checks
The service provides a health endpoint at `/health` for load balancer health checks.

### Database Migrations
Use Alembic for database schema migrations:

```bash
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head
```

## Monitoring

### Logging
The service uses structured logging with correlation IDs for tracking requests through the system.

### Metrics
Key metrics to monitor:
- Trial conversion rates
- Failed payment attempts
- Webhook processing latency
- Subscription churn rates
