# S2B-11: Regional Pods Deployment Service

## Overview

The Regional Pods service manages distributed educational AI infrastructure across geographic regions, ensuring data residency compliance, optimal latency, and disaster recovery capabilities for K-12 educational workloads.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Pod Manager**: Orchestrates regional pod lifecycle and health monitoring
- **Data Residency Engine**: Ensures student data never leaves designated regions
- **Load Balancer**: Intelligent routing based on geography and capacity
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region failover with zero data loss
- **Compliance Monitor**: Real-time FERPA/COPPA regional compliance tracking

### Regional Pod Types

1. **Primary Pods** - Main serving regions (US-West, US-East, EU-Central, APAC)
2. **Edge Pods** - Local district caching and low-latency serving
3. **Backup Pods** - Disaster recovery and data replication
4. **Compliance Pods** - Region-specific regulatory data processing

## Features

###  Geographic Distribution
- Intelligent region selection based on school district location
- Sub-millisecond latency routing for real-time educational applications
- Automatic failover with health monitoring across all regions

###  Data Residency Compliance
- FERPA zone enforcement (student data never crosses state lines without consent)
- EU GDPR compliance with EU-only data processing
- Canadian PIPEDA compliance for Ontario/BC school districts
- Audit trails for all cross-region data movements

###  Performance Optimization
- Adaptive load balancing based on real-time capacity metrics
- ML model caching at edge locations for faster inference
- Automatic scaling based on educational calendar patterns
- Traffic shaping for peak usage periods (school hours, testing seasons)

###  Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time pod health monitoring with 99.99% uptime SLA
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Automated alerting for compliance violations or outages
- Capacity planning with predictive scaling
